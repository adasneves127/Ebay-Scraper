# Ebay-Scraper

This is a python script that used to let you scrape Ebay's webpage for certain items, as well as sorting and filtering results.

This however, will no longer work, since Ebay's search url's and web pages change from time to time, which will break compatibility with this program.


However, when it worked, the results would be put into an HTML file with linked Javascript and CSS, which would allow you to view the results in a web browser, as well as sort by price.

Programmed in 2021
